10/10/2020 v1.0 Intention Repeater MAX created.
10/15/2020 v1.1 Optimized to run faster.
10/16/2020 v1.2 Optimized further by removing benchmark loops in favor of a timer sentinel. This makes the clock more accurate and it runs faster.
10/23/2020 v2.0 Converted to C++ which can be 2X faster and is more efficient. Will support this version from now on. Needs to be compiled with g++.
