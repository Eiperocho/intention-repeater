Intention Repeater Change Log (9/9/2020) by Thomas Sweet aka Anthro Teacher

4/13/2019 intentionrepeater.com domain registered.
1/11/2020 v0.3 Created. Could only go up to 1M iterations per second and was very basic.
8/6/2020 v4.0 Added Heart/Mind Coherence and Clearing Energetic Interference options.
9/6/2020 v5.0 Added Gut to Heart/Mind Coherence option. Added "OM" the highest vibration that made a big difference. Automated to allow running without user input from terminal.
9/7/2020 v5.1 Added Akashic Records option. They provide a greater gamut of emotions such as infinitely subtle variations on Joy. However, may also be very expansive and hard to focus down.
9/8/2020 v5.2 Changed to use ORGONE AETHER RESONATORS and ORGONE BUBBLES.
9/8/2020 v5.3 Added INFINITE ENERGY and INTELLIGENT ENERGY and LOGOS and HR 6819. This helps focus down the Intelligent Infinity. LOGOS really softens the energy and makes it more integrating. Very nice. LOGOS is another name for our galaxy's central black hole/consciousness. HR 6819 is the closest black hole system to Earth and has been relevant in working with the Repeater.
9/9/2020 v5.4 ALL AVAILABLE BENEFICIAL ENERGY GRIDS OF EARTH/GAIA FOCUSED THROUGH CRYSTAL GRID OF EARTH/GAIA. Added NODES AND NULLS OF EARTH/GAIA to work with the grids. Also added 963HZ GOD FREQUENCY. Added SIRIUS B the white dwarf star, since that was what I used during my development to increase my energy density. It makes the energy denser and smoother.
