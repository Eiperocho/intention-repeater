Windows 10 directions for compiling the Intention Repeater MAX v2.2 or greater.

1) Save this sourcecode to your computer in a special folder: https://dev.intentionrepeater.com/cpp/intention_repeater_max.cpp

If you have 64-Bit Windows:

	A) Install MinGW-W64:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download

	With these Options:

	Version: 8.1.0
	Architecture: x86_64
	Threads: posix
	Exception: seh
	Build revision: 0

	B) Open PowerShell by going to the folder where you saved intention_repeater_max.cpp,
		holding Shift, and right-clicking. Then choose: Open PowerShell window here.

	C) Compile the binary executable with the following:

	C:\Program` Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin\g++.exe .\intention_repeater_max.cpp -O3 -o .\intention_repeater_max.exe

	Note, copy/paste without any spaces before the C:\ and without a new line. Then paste and press Enter. If it does nothing,
	and doesn't produce an error message, then that is a good sign.

You should then be able to double-click on the file in Windows: intention_repeater_chat.exe

If you have 32-Bit Windows:

	A) Install MinGW from here:

		https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/

	B) On the MinGW Installation Manager, under Basic Setup, check to install Package: mingw32-gcc-g++-bin
		It should be v9.2.0-2 or greater.

	C) Choose Installation -> Apply Changes

	D) Open PowerShell by going to the folder where you saved intention_repeater_max.cpp,
		holding Shift, and right-clicking. Then choose: Open PowerShell window here.

	E) Compile the binary executable with the following:

		C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe .\intention_repeater_max.cpp -O3 -o .\intention_repeater_max.exe

	Note, copy/paste without any spaces before the C:\ and without a new line. Then paste and press Enter. If it does nothing,
	and doesn't produce an error message, then that is a good sign.

	You will find the intention_repeater_max.exe file in your folder.


You should then be able to double-click on the file in Windows: intention_repeater_max.exe

This v2.2 does up to 60+ Million repetitions per second of an intention on my new i3 with the 64-Bit version.

I recommend Notepad++ for editing the .cpp file: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
